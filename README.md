Program 1:
Write a program to implement two classes Employee and Boss. Take name and age as input. Employee id gets generated automatically when
a new employee (object of employee class) is created. Boss decides the salary of employee. Also, Boss has the capability to 
increase the salary (Employee has a variable named salary) of the Employee. Display the details and the updated salary of employee.

Program 2:
Classes fourwheeler and twowheeler inherit from the parent class vehicle. Class data members and member functions will depend on you.
Hence each implementation is expected to be unique. Ultimate objective is to display the name and mileage of a 2 or 4 wheeler (along with other details of
your choice) depending on user input. Since this is a program on inheritance design the program such that meaningful properties are inherited.

Program 3:
Create an integer array. Print the array using pointer and Array name itself.
Create an array of pointers that point to each location of the integer array.
